Hey folks!!
To use my project:
1. Clone the repo
2. install all the dependencies using npm
3. Then start frontend by npm start in the main directory
4. In the new terminal, navigate to the backend, using: >>cd backend
5. after reaching the backend; using npm start
6. Both will be running; but make sure you changed the MongoDB Atlas related stuff in code
